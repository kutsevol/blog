Blog written on Django.

This is my second personal blog.
The First blog was written on static site generator - Pelican.
Link - https://kutsevol.github.io/.

The main idea is to write articles about tools that are interesting and popular. Also, the blog serves not to lose interesting articles;) 

**Instructions:**

1. clone repository
2. make docker-build
3. make docker-run
